And raise the goddess to the sky;<br />

A rudeness?&mdash;Yes,&mdash;I speak my thoughts,<br />
For truth upbraids her with her faults.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How wretched, <span class="smcaplc">CHLOE</span>, then am I,</span><br />
Who love you, and yet cannot lie;<br />

But shall the senseless fop impart<br />
The softest passion to your heart,<br />

Your taste for flatt&#8217;ry I could please.<br />
And similes in each dull line,<br />
Like glow-worms in the dark, should shine.<br />
What if I say your lips disclose<br />
The freshness of the op&#8217;ning rose?<br />

Enripen&#8217;d by refreshing show&#8217;rs?<br />

From sour reserve, or levity;<br />
Good-natur&#8217;d mirth, an open heart,<br />
And looks unskill&#8217;d in any art;<br />
Humility, enough to own<br />
The frailties which a friend makes known;<br />
And decent pride, enough to know<br />
The worth that virtue can bestow.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These are the charms which ne&#8217;er decay,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;And pray, sir, may I be so bold,</span><br />
To hope your pretty tale is told;<br />
And next demand without a cavil,<br />
What new <span class="smcaplc">UTOPIA</span> do you travel?<br />
Upon my word, these high-flown fancies<br />
Shew depth of learning in romances.<br />
Why, what unfashion&#8217;d stuff you tell us,<br />
Of buckram dames, and tiptoe fellows!<br />
Go, child, and when you&#8217;re grown maturer,<br />
You&#8217;ll shoot your next opinion surer.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;O, such a pretty knack at painting,</span><br />
And all for soft&#8217;ning, and for sainting!<br />
Guess now, who can, a single feature,<br />
Thro&#8217; the whole piece of female nature:<br />
Then, mark! my looser hand may fit<br />
The lines too coarse for love to hit.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;&#8217;Tis said, that woman prone to changing,</span><br />
Thro&#8217; all the rounds of folly ranging,<br />
On life&#8217;s uncertain ocean riding,<br />
No reason, rule, nor rudder guiding,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>Is like the comet&#8217;s wand&#8217;ring light,<br />
Eccentric, ominous, and bright;<br />
Tractless and shifting as the wind,<br />
A sea whose fathom none can find;<br />
A moon, still changing and revolving,<br />
A riddle, past all human solving;<br />
A bliss, a plague, a heav&#8217;n, a hell,<br />
A&mdash;&mdash;something, that no man can tell.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Now learn a secret from a friend,</span><br />
But keep your counsel and attend:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Tho&#8217; in their tempers thought so distant,</span><br />
Nor with their sex, nor selves consistent,<br />
&#8217;Tis but the diff&#8217;rence of a name,<br />
And ev&#8217;ry woman is the same.<br />
For as the world, however vary&#8217;d,<br />
And thro&#8217; unnumber&#8217;d changes carry&#8217;d,<br />
Of elemental modes and forms,<br />
Clouds, meteors, colours, calms, and storms;<br />
Tho&#8217; in a thousand suits array&#8217;d,<br />
Is of one subject matter made;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>So, sir, a woman&#8217;s constitution,<br />
The world&#8217;s enigma, finds solution.<br />
And let her form be what you will,<br />
I am the subject essence still.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;With the first spark of female sense,</span><br />
The speck of being, I commence;<br />
Within the womb make fresh advances,<br />
And dictate future qualms and fancies;<br />
Thence in the growing form expand,<br />
With childhood travel hand in hand,<br />
And give a taste of all their joys,<br />
In gewgaws, rattles, pomp, and noise.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;And now, familiar and unaw&#8217;d,</span><br />
I send the flutt&#8217;ring soul abroad;<br />
Prais&#8217;d for her shape, her air, her mien,<br />
The little goddess, and the queen,<br />
Takes at her infant shrine oblation,<br />
And drinks sweet draughts of adulation.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Now, blooming, tall, erect, and fair,</span><br />
To dress becomes her darling care;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>The realms of beauty then I bound,<br />
I swell the hoop&#8217;s enchanted round;<br />
Shrink in the waist&#8217;s descending size,<br />
Heav&#8217;d in the snowy bosom rise,<br />
High on the floating lappet sail,<br />
Or curl&#8217;d in tresses kiss the gale.<br />
Then to her glass I lead the fair,<br />
And shew the lovely idol there,<br />
Where, struck as by divine emotion,<br />
She bows with most sincere devotion;<br />
And numb&#8217;ring ev&#8217;ry beauty o&#8217;er,<br />
In secret bids the world adore.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Then all for parking and parading,</span><br />
Coqueting, dancing, masquerading;<br />
For balls, plays, courts, and crowds, what passion!<br />
And churches, sometimes, if the fashion:<br />
For woman&#8217;s sense of right and wrong<br />
Is rul&#8217;d by the almighty throng;<br />
Still turns to each meander tame,<br />
And swims the straw of ev&#8217;ry stream.<br />
Her soul intrinsic worth rejects,<br />
Accomplish&#8217;d only in defects,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>Such excellence is her ambition,<br />
Folly her wisest acquisition;<br />
And ev&#8217;n from pity and disdain,<br />
She&#8217;ll cull some reason to be vain.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Thus, sir, from ev&#8217;ry form and feature,</span><br />
The wealth and wants of female nature,<br />
And ev&#8217;n from vice, which you&#8217;d admire,<br />
I gather fuel to my fire,<br />
And on the very base of shame,<br />
Erect my monument of fame.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Let me another truth attempt,</span><br />
Of which your godship has not dreamt:<br />
Those shining virtues which you muster,<br />
Whence think you they derive their lustre?<br />
From native honour and devotion!<br />
O yes! a mighty likely notion!<br />
Trust me, from titled dames to spinners,<br />
&#8217;Tis I make saints, whoe&#8217;er make sinners;<br />
&#8217;Tis I instruct them to withdraw,<br />
And hold presumptuous man in awe;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>For female worth as I inspire,<br />
In just degrees, still mounts the higher,<br />
And <span class="smcaplc">VIRTUE</span> so extremely nice,<br />
Demands long toil and mighty price;<br />
Like <span class="smcaplc">SAMPSON&#8217;S</span> pillars, fix&#8217;d elate,<br />
I bear the sex&#8217;s tott&#8217;ring state;<br />
Sap these, and in a moment&#8217;s space,<br />
Down sinks the fabric to its base.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Alike from titles, and from toys,</span><br />
I spring, the fount of female joys;<br />
In ev&#8217;ry widow, wife, and miss,<br />
The sole artificer of bliss.<br />
For them each tropic I explore;<br />
I cleave the sand of ev&#8217;ry shore;<br />
To them uniting <span class="smcaplc">INDIA&#8217;S</span> sail,<br />
<span class="smcap">Sab&aelig;a</span> breathes her farthest gale;<br />
For them the bullion I refine,<br />
Dig sense and virtue from the mine;<br />
And from the bowels of invention,<br />
Spin out the various arts you mention.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Nor bliss alone my pow&#8217;rs bestow,</span><br />
They hold the sov&#8217;reign balm of woe;<br />
Beyond the stoic&#8217;s boasted art,<br />
I soothe the heavings of the heart;<br />
To pain give splendor, and relief,<br />
And gild the pallid face of grief.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Alike the palace and the plain,</span><br />
Admit the glories of my reign;<br />
Thro&#8217; ev&#8217;ry age, in ev&#8217;ry nation,<br />
Taste, talents, tempers, state, and station,<br />
Whate&#8217;er a woman says, I say;<br />
Whate&#8217;er a woman spends, I pay;<br />
Alike I fill and empty bags,<br />
Flutter in finery and rags;<br />
With light coquets thro&#8217; folly range,<br />
And with the prude disdain to change.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;And now, you&#8217;d think, &#8217;twixt you and I,</span><br />
That things were ripe for a reply&mdash;<br />
But soft&mdash;and while I&#8217;m in the mood,<br />
Kindly permit me to conclude;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Their utmost mazes to unravel,<br />
And touch the farthest step they travel:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;When ev&#8217;ry pleasure&#8217;s run a-ground,</span><br />
And folly tir&#8217;d thro&#8217; many a round;<br />
The nymph, conceiving discontent hence,<br />
May ripen to an hour&#8217;s repentance,<br />
And vapours shed in pious moisture,<br />
Dismiss her to a church or cloister;<br />
Then on I lead her, with devotion<br />
Conspicuous in her dress and motion;<br />
Inspire the heav&#8217;nly-breathing air,<br />
Roll up the lucid eye in pray&#8217;r,<br />
Soften the voice, and in the face<br />
Look melting harmony and grace.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Thus far extends my friendly pow&#8217;r,</span><br />
Nor quits her in her latest hour;<br />
The couch of decent pain I spread,<br />
In form recline her languid head;<br />
Her thoughts I methodize in death,<br />
And part not with her parting breath;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>Then do I set, in order bright,<br />
A length of fun&#8217;ral pomp to sight;<br />
The glitt&#8217;ring tapers, and attire,<br />
The plumes that whiten o&#8217;er her bier;<br />
And last, presenting to her eye<br />
Angelic fineries on high,<br />
To scenes of painted bliss I waft her,<br />
And form the heav&#8217;n she hopes hereafter.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8216;In truth,&#8217; rejoin&#8217;d <span class="smcaplc">LOVE&#8217;S</span> gentle god,</span><br />
&#8216;You&#8217;ve gone a tedious length of road;<br />
And, strange! in all the toilsome way<br />
No house of kind refreshment lay;<br />
No nymph, whose virtues might have tempted<br />
To hold her from her sex exempted.&#8217;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;For one, we&#8217;ll never quarrel, man,</span><br />
Take her, and keep her, if you can;<br />
And pleas&#8217;d I yield to your petition,<br />
Since every fair, by such permission,<br />
Will hold herself the one selected,<br />
And so my system stands protected.&#8221;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8216;O deaf to <span class="smcaplc">VIRTUE</span>, deaf to <span class="smcaplc">GLORY</span>,</span><br />
To truths divinely vouch&#8217;d in story!&#8217;<br />
The godhead, in his zeal return&#8217;d,<br />
And kindling at her malice burn&#8217;d.<br />
Then sweetly rais&#8217;d his voice, and told<br />
Of heav&#8217;nly nymphs, rever&#8217;d of old;<br />
<span class="smcap">Hypsipyle</span>, who sav&#8217;d her sire;<br />
And <span class="smcaplc">PORTIA&#8217;S</span> love, approv&#8217;d by fire;<br />
Alike <span class="smcaplc">PENELOPE</span> was quoted,<br />
Nor laurel&#8217;d <span class="smcaplc">DAPHNE</span> pass&#8217;d unnoted,<br />
Nor <span class="smcaplc">LAODAMIA&#8217;S</span> fatal garter,<br />
Nor fam&#8217;d <span class="smcaplc">LUCRETIA</span>, honour&#8217;s martyr,<br />
<span class="smcap">Alceste&#8217;s</span> voluntary steel,<br />
And <span class="smcaplc">CATHERINE</span> smiling on the wheel.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But who can hope to plant conviction,</span><br />
Where cavil grows on contradiction!<br />
Some she evades, or disavows,<br />
Demurs to all, and none allows;<br />
A kind of ancient things, call&#8217;d fables!<br />
And thus the goddess turn&#8217;d the tables.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now both in argument grew high,</span><br />
And choler flash&#8217;d from either eye;<br />
Nor wonder each refus&#8217;d to yield<br />
The conquest of so fair a field.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When happily arriv&#8217;d in view</span><br />
A goddess, whom our grandames knew,<br />
Of aspect grave, and sober gait,<br />
Majestic, awful, and sedate,<br />
As heav&#8217;n&#8217;s autumnal eve serene,<br />
Where not a cloud o&#8217;ercasts the scene,<br />
Once <span class="smcaplc">PRUDENCE</span> call&#8217;d, a matron fam&#8217;d,<br />
And in old <span class="smcaplc">ROME CORNELIA</span> nam&#8217;d.<br />
Quick, at a venture, both agree<br />
To leave their strife to her decree.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now by each the facts were stated,</span><br />
In form and manner as related;<br />
The case was short&mdash;They crav&#8217;d opinion,<br />
Which held o&#8217;er females chief dominion?<br />
When thus the goddess, answering mild,<br />
First shook her gracious head, and smil&#8217;d:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Alas! how willing to comply,</span><br />
Yet how unfit a judge am I!<br />
In times of golden date, &#8217;tis true,<br />
I shar&#8217;d the fickle sex with you;<br />
But from their presence long precluded,<br />
Or held as one whose form intruded,<br />
Full fifty annual suns can tell,<br />
Prudence has bid the sex farewell.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this dilemma, what to do,</span><br />
Or who to think of, neither knew;<br />
For both, still bias&#8217;d in opinion,<br />
And arrogant of sole dominion,<br />
Were forc&#8217;d to hold the case compounded,<br />
Or leave the quarrel where they found it.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in the nick, a rural fair,</span><br />
Of inexperienc&#8217;d gait and air,<br />
Who ne&#8217;er had cross&#8217;d the neighb&#8217;ring lake,<br />
Nor seen the world beyond a wake;<br />
With cambric coif, and kerchief clean,<br />
Trip&#8217;d lightly by them o&#8217;er the green.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8216;Now, now!&#8217; cry&#8217;d <span class="smcaplc">LOVE&#8217;S</span> triumphant child,</span><br />
And at approaching conquest smil&#8217;d;<br />
&#8216;If <span class="smcaplc">VANITY</span> will once be guided,<br />
Our diff&#8217;rence soon may be decided:<br />
Behold you wench, a fit occasion,<br />
To try your force of gay persuasion.&mdash;<br />
Go you, while I retire aloof,<br />
Go, put those boasted pow&#8217;rs to proof;<br />
And if your prevalence of art<br />
Transcends my yet unerring dart,<br />
I give the fav&#8217;rite contest o&#8217;er,<br />
And ne&#8217;er will boast my empire more.&#8217;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At once, so said and so consented,</span><br />
And well our goddess seem&#8217;d contented,<br />
Nor pausing, made a moment&#8217;s stand,<br />
But tript, and took the girl in hand.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meanwhile the <span class="smcaplc">GODHEAD</span>, unalarm&#8217;d,</span><br />
As one to each occasion arm&#8217;d,<br />
Forth from his quiver cull&#8217;d a dart,<br />
That erst had wounded many a heart;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Then bending, drew it to the head,<br />
The bowstring twang&#8217;d, the arrow fled,<br />
And to her secret soul address&#8217;d,<br />
Transfix&#8217;d the whiteness of her breast.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But here the <span class="smcaplc">DAME</span>, whose guardian care</span><br />
Had to a moment watch&#8217;d the fair,<br />
At once her pocket mirror drew,<br />
And held the wonder full in view;<br />
As quickly, rang&#8217;d in order bright,<br />
A thousand beauties rush&#8217;d to sight,<br />
A world of charms, till now unknown,<br />
A world revealed to her alone;<br />
Enraptur&#8217;d stands the love-sick maid,<br />
Suspended o&#8217;er the darling shade;<br />
Here only fixes to admire,<br />
And centres every fond desire.</td></tr></table>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
